        <h3 class="interesting">Whiskers is one of our best cuddlers and has won awards for his cuteness!</h3>
        <p class="body-content">In 2018, Whiskers won the Kitty Cuteness award and has been on tour around the country for the last year. So far, his favorite place to visit was New York, where he met Lady Gaga. The people he has cuddled with include the Obamas, Emma Watson, Chris Hemsworth, and Bono. However, last month Whiskers infamously turned down cuddling with Taylor Swift, stating he hates country music.</p>

        <p class="body-content" id="whiskers"><q>I am very soft and you should be grateful to cuddle with me.</q></p>
        <p class="body-content">In 2019, Whiskers hopes to travel the world. The next place he'd like to visit in Croatia so he can lounge on the beach in the sun and enjoy lots of tasty fish. He loves to travel, as long as he is flying first class. If you love to travel, Whiskers would be a great kitty for you!</p>
        <p class="body-content">Whisker's New Years resolution was to read more books. He is currently reading Educated by Tara Westover and loving it! If you have any book recommendations for Whiskers, please send them to whiskers@whisker.com.</p>
